# End-to-End Data Science Project

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data science pipeline designed to automate and modularize the process of data ingestion, processing, and experimentation. It is structured for scalability, reproducibility, and ease of collaboration, using best practices in Python packaging and workflow management.

## Key Components
- **config/config.yaml**: Main configuration for the pipeline, including artifact locations and data sources.
- **params.yaml**: Stores hyperparameters and other adjustable settings.
- **schema.yaml**: Defines the expected data schema.
- **src/end_to_end_ds/components/**: Contains modular pipeline steps (e.g., data ingestion).
- **src/end_to_end_ds/pipeline/**: Orchestrates the execution of pipeline stages.
- **src/end_to_end_ds/utils/common.py**: Utility functions for file I/O, directory management, etc.
- **src/end_to_end_ds/entity/config_entity.py**: Data classes for configuration objects.
- **logs/logging.log**: Centralized logging for debugging and monitoring.
- **research/**: Jupyter notebooks for prototyping and analysis.
- **Makefile**: Automation for setup, cleaning, and running pipeline steps.

## Makefile Commands
- `make help` — List all available commands with descriptions.
- `make clean` — Remove the virtual environment and all Python cache files.
- `make setup` — Clean, create a new virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the template script to scaffold files.
- `make install` — Install all dependencies from requirements.txt.
- `make run-data-ingestion` — Run the data ingestion pipeline step.

## How the Pipeline Works
1. **Configuration**: All paths and parameters are managed via YAML files for easy modification.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Downloads and extracts data from a remote source, as defined in `config.yaml`.
3. **Pipeline Orchestration**: Each stage (e.g., ingestion) is modular and can be run independently or as part of a larger workflow.
4. **Logging**: All steps are logged for traceability.
5. **Experimentation**: Notebooks in the `research/` folder allow for rapid prototyping and analysis.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `make setup` to initialize the environment.
3. Use `make run-data-ingestion` to execute the data ingestion pipeline.
4. Explore and modify notebooks in the `research/` folder for experimentation.

## Notes
- The project is designed for extensibility; add new pipeline components as needed.
- Use the Makefile for common tasks to ensure consistency.
- All logs are stored in `logs/logging.log` for easy debugging.
